**Overall:**
Great work on this homework! Moving forward, I suggest you take a bit of time to review some fundamental stats, and maybe some math as well. These mathematical properities/tools will come in handy very soon.

**Some notes**  
* On question 2a. we are going to assume that the data is sourced from a representative sample, yes (by the way, this is a key thing to focus on for any experiment to hold validity), but we also may have some other assumptions of the _mathematical distribution_ of the data. A very common distribution for continuous values is the [normal distribution or gaussian](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/more-on-normal-distributions/v/introduction-to-the-normal-distribution). If we make an assumption about the data, and validate that assumption via a statistical test or plot, then it allows us to perform subsequent tests and find out even more about the behavior of our data!
* Given the notes above, question 2b. is asking for you to test your assumption via a statistical test or a plot (histogram, KDE, or the like).
* Having outliers will _skew_ our results, but how? Why would this be the case? If you were to suspect this, how would you prove it?
